# UserOffboarding
We developed the code and report [not uploaded in this repository] as a part of our capstone project work with Ann Arbor ITS. Winter 2023.

This repository has the code for an automated mail alert system that monitors user affiliation changes using Python scripts. 

The old practice of manual log queries and affiliation change observations was not only cumbersome but also poses potential security risks due to delays in observation. To address this, the proposed solution automates the process of accessing the application system and logs to generate alerts. The use of Python scripts enables efficient performance and scalability while reducing the need for manual involvement. 

The developed solution is expected to improve the overall security and monitoring of the system by providing real-time alerts and reducing response time.
